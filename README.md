Tic Tac Toe

In this game, the bot selects next move based on a strategy to win every time, or tie.

The bot selects his move based on this logic:
  1. Bot checks for Player's winning move, and blocks, if found.
  2. Bot checks for a winning move.
  3. If open, bot takes middle square.
  4. Bot takes a corner.

Future update:
  Make adjustments to how the bot selects next move, so that it creates the possibility of winning.
